- [SVS-HF_Patch](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/SVS-HF_Patch)

## Installation
1. Install prerequisites
2. Download from releases
3. Extract into game folder (.DLL file should be in `/GAME_FOLDER/BepInEx/plugins/`)

## Features
- Toggle 3D rooms perspective on/off if [SVS_BepisPlugins](https://github.com/IllusionMods/BepisPlugins) and [ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) is installed (already included in SVS-HF_Patch)

## Notes
